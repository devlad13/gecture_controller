This project demonstrates an innovative gesture-based UI system developed using Unity and MediaPipe, enabling users to select video games from a list using only hand movementsâ€”no mouse or keyboard needed.

By integrating MediaPipe's hand tracking capabilities with Unity's interactive UI framework, we created an intuitive and immersive interface where users can scroll through and select games simply by moving their hands in front of a camera.

This project explores the potential of natural user interfaces (NUI) in gaming environments and can be expanded into a complete hands-free menu navigation system or VR/AR applications.
